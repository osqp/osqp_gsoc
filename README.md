# OSQP Summer of Code

## IDEAS

- Idea : implement anderson acceleration for OSQP using a home-rolled QR method.   We have a Julia version already.
- Idea : implement the differentiation stuff.
- Idea : finalise the user definable linear algebra stuff (just needs CMAKE updates I think), then finalise support for BLAS using it (done as a prototype) and add some kind of basic GPU / CUDA example using it also.
- Idea: use GitHub Actions for CI
